# Stop_Watch

Stopwatch , simulate a stopwatch. It should 
provide two methods: Start and Stop. We call the start method first, and the stop method next. 
Then we ask the stopwatch about the duration between start and stop. 
Duration is a value in TimeSpan duration is displayed on the console. 
We should also be able to use a stopwatch multiple times.
So we may start and stop it and then 
start and stop it again. 
A stopwatch doesn't start twice in a row
